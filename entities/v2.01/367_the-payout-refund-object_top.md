A **Payout Refund is a request only generated by Mangopay when the bank of the user rejected the transfer.**
In this case we reimburse the payout and so the funds into the wallet. So the payout object remains in « Succeeded » but we create a refund object and you receive a PAYOUT_REFUND_SUCCEEDED notification and event.
