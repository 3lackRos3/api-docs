A Pay-in by card and via web interface is a request to process a payment to a wallet for a dedicated user.

You need to do your tests in sandbox mode only with the [testing cards](/guide/testing-payments).

[alert type="info"]There is a KYC limit on Pay-Ins in order to fight fraud, money laundering and financing of terrorism. You have to send some documents through the API. [Please check the rules to go over the limits](/guide/kyc)[/alert]
