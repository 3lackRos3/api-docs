The client wallet is very similar to a normal wallet except the parameters "Description" and "Owners" are removed. Currently, there are two types of client wallet (specified by the "FundsType" parameter) - "FEES" where your collected turnover is stored and "CREDIT" where repudiations are taken from. A normal wallet for a user has the "FundsType" of "DEFAULT".
[alert type="info"]Client wallets are created automatically when they're first required; and there is only one client wallet "FundsType" per currency[/alert]
Note that you view the transactions for a client wallet [entity_link entity="275"]here[/entity_link].

We set up a system of aliasing so the naming of your wallets is clearer for you. For example, your wallets in the currency EUR will be called FEES_EUR and CREDIT_EUR.
