MANGOPAY recommends using [ScanPay](https://we.scanpay.it/concept) for mobile apps. ScanPay lets your users scan their credit card on mobile applications. There is no additional fees, you just have to have a contract with them.

**Mobile payments made seamless**

To scan a credit card, the user simply has to hold the credit card briefly in front of the deviceâ€™s camera: the credit card details will automatically be recognized. ScanPay does not process payments, but it can be used with MangoPay.
