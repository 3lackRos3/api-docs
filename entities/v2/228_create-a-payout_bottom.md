[alert type="info"]
* In production environment BankWire PayOuts will have a CREATED status until they are treated by our compliance team (which happens several times a day)
* In sandbox environment BankWire PayOuts will have a CREATED status until you send us an email at support@mangopay.com with the id of the payout and the demand to reject or validate it.
* When you created the **production Client Id** you filled the field Name which will be used on your users bank statements
* A Bankwire could fail after it’s passed to "SUCCEEDED" – in this case, a refund of the PayOut will be made. More info is available here under « Payout error codes »
