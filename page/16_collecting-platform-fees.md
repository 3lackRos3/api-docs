# MANGOPAY fees
**Summary**: MANGOPAY collects 1.8% + € 0.18 fees only per cash-in transaction in €. We never charge your client, but only you. You can decide to collect your fees during the PayIn, during a Transfert or during a PayOut.

**Prerequisite**: Let’s say for this example that your platform gets 10% commission and that you decide to get this fees when you do a bankwire (from the wallet to the bank account).

**Use case:**
1. The user A does a Payin of 100€.
2. User A receives 100€ in his wallet.
3. User A does a Transfert on user B’s wallet
3. User B decides to do a Payout to its bank account.
4. User B receives in his bank account 90€ (100€ – 10% of the fees that you get).

It is at this moment that the 10€ of fees are taken and blocked for a month by Mangopay in a specific fees wallet for your platform. Please notice that you do not have access to this wallet, only Mangopay does.
All collected fees during the month are given back to you at the end of the month – the mangopay fees.
So with our example you will receive 8.02€ (10€ – 1,98€ mangopay fees).
